Data Wrangling With Python

Objectives

This lab uses Colab to demonstrate data wrangling techniques in Python. The objectives include:

1. Handling missing values
2. Correcting data format
3. Standardizing and normalizing data

What is the purpose of data wrangling?
Data wrangling is the process of converting data from its initial format to a format that is better suited for analysis.

Data Standardization
Data is often collected from different sources in various formats. Data standardization refers to the process of transforming data into a common format, enabling meaningful comparisons and analysis. In some cases, data standardization involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

Data Normalization
Why is normalization important? Normalization is the process of transforming the values of multiple variables into a similar range. This is useful for comparing variables with different scales. Common normalization techniques include scaling the variable so that the average is 0, scaling the variable so that the variance is 1, or scaling the variable so that the values range from 0 to 1.

Binning
Why do we use binning? Binning is a process of converting continuous numerical variables into discrete categorical "bins" for grouped analysis. Binning allows for the analysis of trends and patterns within specific ranges or categories.

Please refer to the provided lab materials in Colab for detailed examples and implementation of these data wrangling techniques using Python.
